# NavigoExpress
The "biggest" VB.NET program I made when I was a kid, which is not even finished. This is a web browser, with no working tab support, which uses Internet Explorer's engine.
Made in 2010-2011 with the IDE [SoftwareZator](https://github.com/veler/SoftwareZator-2012 "SoftwareZator's 2012 source code").

This code is provided AS-IS, and without any license. I won't modify it.
(seriously, I just wanted to free up space on my hard drive, that's why I uploaded it ðŸ˜‚)

Unfortunately, I lose the REAL source files. This repo contains only the binaries.
