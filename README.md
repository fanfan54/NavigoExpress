# NavigoExpress
The "biggest" VB.NET program I made when I was a kid, which is not even finished. This is a web browser, with no working tab support, which uses Internet Explorer's engine.
Made in 2010-2011 with the IDE [SoftwareZator](https://github.com/veler/SoftwareZator-2012 "SoftwareZator's 2012 source code").

I had been inspired by the web browser from this VB.NET MOOC: https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-vb-net/tp-navigateur-web

The graphical elements (icons) have been designed on... Microsoft Paint!

This code is provided AS-IS, and without any license. I won't modify it.
(seriously, I just wanted to free up space on my hard drive, that's why I uploaded it ðŸ˜‚)

Unfortunately, I lose the REAL source files. This repo contains only the binaries.

Also available in C++, compiled for Linux amd64 (binaries and source code are coming soon).

It uses Qt for the GUI, and is just a modified version of the code taken from this TP (also in a MOOC): https://openclassrooms.com/courses/programmez-avec-le-langage-c/tp-znavigo-le-navigateur-web-des-zeros
