# Navigo Express
The "biggest" VB.NET program I made when I was a kid, which is not even finished. This is a web browser, with no working tab support, which uses Internet Explorer's engine from .NET.
Made in 2010-2011 with the IDE [SoftwareZator](https://github.com/veler/SoftwareZator-2012 "SoftwareZator's 2012 source code").

I had been inspired by the web browser from this VB.NET MOOC: https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-vb-net/tp-navigateur-web

The graphical elements (icons) have been designed on... Microsoft Paint!

This code is provided AS-IS, and without any license. I won't modify it.
(seriously, I just wanted to free up space on my hard drive, that's why I uploaded it ðŸ˜‚)

Unfortunately, I lose the REAL source files. This repo contains only the binaries.

# Navigo Simply is the name of the more advanced and more recent edition

I also coded a version available in C++, in 2011-2012 I guess, only compiled for Linux amd64.

**Disclaimer: LefÃ¨vre-Services is a fictional name, I am not affiliated with the real LefÃ¨vre-Services french company.**

It uses Qt 4 for the GUI, WebKit as the engine, and is just a modified version of the zNavigo's code taken from this TP (also in a MOOC): https://openclassrooms.com/courses/programmez-avec-le-langage-c/tp-znavigo-le-navigateur-web-des-zeros

This time it has multi-tab support, and a parental control, bookmarks, history and other things... I never implemented these features except the multi-tab support.

### Where is Navigo Simply?
**I will not disclose the binaries or the source code for Navigo Simply, but I invite you to download the original work from Mathieu Nebra and Matthieu Schaller who wrote zNavigo, because Navigo Simply is basically a fork of zNavigo for my personal use.**

## License (for Navigo Express)
I wrote, and compiled NavigoExpress myself using the IDE [SoftwareZator 2012](https://github.com/veler/SoftwareZator-2012 "SoftwareZator's 2012 source code") made by **Veler Software** (its source code has been released on GitHub under the Apache License 2.0, it's an abandonware), this project contains no restricted content (but it contains some compiled DLLs from the SoftwareZator IDE, I think that's not an issue since their source code is publicly available under the Apache License 2.0). It contains no code from the VB.NET MOOC as I rewrote everything myself.

I decided to release the code under the Apache License 2.0.
